# Dynamic Mode Decomposition study

See Google Colaboratory notebook for the full study, including code implementations.

Note that the notebook depends on data stored on my personal Google drive. Those data are too big to include in this repo, so I will try to always commit an executed version of the notebook. Apologies in advance if you visit this notebook and the code has not been executed--in that case, check again later (or email me at daviso53@msu.edu).
